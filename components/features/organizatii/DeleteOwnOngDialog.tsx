/**
 * `Șterge ONG` for the Admin ONG's own organization ("Business rules.txt": the
 * option is theirs, from their own Acțiuni menu, with no approval step).
 *
 * Same shape as `DeleteOngButton`, which serves the FDSC organizations table,
 * with two differences: it is mounted by the menu instead of owning a trigger
 * of its own — so it survives the dropdown closing — and it redirects
 * afterwards. Deleting the organization ends the admin's membership, so
 * `/dashboard/ong/profil` is a page they may no longer be allowed to load;
 * `deleteMyOngAction` reads their post-deletion role back from the API and
 * returns where they belong (`/dashboard/individual` for a demoted admin,
 * `/dashboard/ong` for one who still runs another organization).
 *
 * Deliberately no typed confirmation: the confirm dialog stands on its own.
